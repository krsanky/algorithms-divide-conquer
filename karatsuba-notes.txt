Hello Eric, from my old post further down, here is what you do:

Check the inputs (n1 and n2) and pick the length of the largest
number.

Divide that length by 2.  If the length is odd, round up.  This
result will be the n/2 in the formulaes above.

Split both numbers into a right side of n/2 digits and set the left
side to the rest of the digits (no matter how many).  If the smallest
number has less than n/2 digits, then set the right side to the
entire number and the left side to zero.

In your second example:

Largest number is 5463782

There are 7 digits

n/2 is 4 ( that is 7 / 2 rounded up).

n is 8

Set b and d to 4 digits:

3782 and 0432

Set a and c to the remaining digits:

546 and 0

Proceed with Karatsuba recursions.

Hope this helps.

===================================

Anyone willing to do the math for 28 and 100? I keep getting a StackOverflowException. I'm pretty sure I have messed up n and n/2 and even after reading the explanations I just can't get it right.

    Quick manual calculation:

    set n/2 = 1 (therefore n=2):

    a = 2

    b = 8

    c = 10

    d = 0

    z0 = ac = 2 * 10 = 20

    z1 = bd = 8 * 0 = 0

    z2 = (a+b) * (c+d) - z0 - z1 = 10 * 10 - 20 - 0 = 80

    Since n = 2,

    result = z0 * 10^2 + z2 * 10 + z1 = 20*100 + 80 * 10 + 0 = 2800

    Hope this helps.
